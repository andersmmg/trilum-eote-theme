# EOTE Theme for Trilium Notes 
## Inspired by the GitHub dark dimmed website style
What i like about the Style is how easy on the eyes it is. For me it makes content more readable and is good for productive use.

## Installation
1. Create a new note inside your Trilium Notes and set the Note Type to _CSS_
2. Copy the Theme CSS code inside the Note you just created
3. Add the label _#appCss_ (You can do that in the _Owned Attributes_ on the top of your note)
4. Reload (Ctrl+R)

*I'm doing my best to implement improvements and fix issues as soon as i see them. I'll update the theme from time to time.
Feel free to leave a message if i can help somehow.*
