# EOTE Theme for Trilium Notes 

*Inspired by the GitHub dark dimmed website style.*

What i like about the style is how easy on the eyes it is. For me it makes content more readable and is good for productive use.

## Installation
- Create a new note inside your Trilium Notes and set the Note Type to _CSS_
- Copy the content of the themes .css file inside the Note you just created
- Add the label _#appCss_ 
  - You can do that in the _Owned Attributes_ on the top of your note (Alt+a)
  - If are currently using other custom themes, make sure the midnight theme is the only one with the _#appCss_ label 
- Reload (Ctrl+R)
